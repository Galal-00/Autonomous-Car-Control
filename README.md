# Autonomous Car Control System

## Overview

A communication and control system for an autonomous car prototype, enabling a PC to send control commands and receive real-time data updates. The objective is for the PC to control the car's speed, direction (forward or backward), and wheel angle through a UART communication interface. A dashboard in the form of an LCD Display shows the interpretted commands of the message and the current time.

AVR-Based MCU receives a data frame through UART-PC communication. PC endpoint is simulated as a virtual terminal, interpreting the communication frame and maps its values into the speed, direction, and orientation of the autonomous car.

#### MCU Connected Components
- DC Motor (represents speed)
- Stepper and Servo Motors (represent Angle)
- LCD (represents dashboard)
- Virtual Terminal (for communication)

#### Description
1. **Current Time:**
   - MCU uses 8-bit Timer and GPIO to interface with LCD Display and display time in 'hh:mm:ss' format.
   - Time starts at 00:00:00 and is updated continuously using the Timer and interrupt controller.
   
2. **Speed and Angle Control:**
   - User types a message in the Virtual Terminal and presses Enter key to end message.
   - MCU reads the message and checks that it complies with the used communication frame standard.
   - Speed and direction are interpreted from the message and DC motor speed is set.
   - Angle and direction are interpreted from the message and stepper and servo motors angles are set.
 
3. **Dashboard Control:**
   - After the message is interpretted, The LCD Displays the current speed and angle.
   - The +/- sign represents forward/backward in case of speed, and right or left in case of angle.

4. **Button Press Action:**
   - If the user presses the push button and the temperature is between 40°C and 50°C, MCU1 sends a code to MCU2 through UART, indicating to shut down the machine.

### Communication Frame

The UART-PC communication frame follows this structure:
```
XXXAYYBE
```
1. **XXX:** Speed of the DC motor, controlling the wheels' speed (0 to 100).
2. **A:** Direction of the DC motor, controlling the wheels' speed (F for forward, B for backward).
3. **YY:** Angle of the stepper/servo motor, controlling the wheel angle (0 to 45).
4. **B:** Direction of the stepper/servo motor (R for Right, L for Left), with the north of the car as the reference.
5. **E:** Indicator of the end of the frame.

### Examples
1. `076F18LE` - Change car speed to 76%, move forward, and tilt wheels 18 degrees to the left.
2. `76F18RE` - Valid frame but violates the agreed standard length.
3. `F100R09E` - Invalid frame (does not match the standard).
4. `076F18R` - Valid frame, missing 'E', considered as noise and ignored.

Invalid messages cause the MCU to send `INVALID MESSAGE` through the virtual terminal.

## Simulation Assumptions

1. DC motor:
   - ACW (Anti-Clockwise) represents forward movement.
   - CW (Clockwise) represents backward movement.
2. Stepepr motor:
   - Each step equals one degree.

## Dashboard Format

The Dashboard follows this format:
```
Speed: X%, Direction +- Y
Time: hh:mm:ss
```
1. **X:** Speed of the DC motor (0 to 100).
2. **Y:** Angle of the stepper/servo motor, controlling the wheel angle (0 to 45).

## Implementation Details

- **Virtual Terminal Communication:** Recieve and messages using UART and interrupts.
- **DC Motor:** Uses GPIO for direction control, and PWM for speed control.
- **Stepper Motor:** Uses GPIO for angle control.
- **Servo Motor:** Uses PWM for angle control.
- **Dashboard Display:** Uses GPIO to write messages. Timer is used to calculate the time.
- **Simulation:** Proteus.
- **Code Editor:** Microchip Studio.
